# Enhanced Blockly App

This is a web-based visual programming application using Google's Blockly library. It allows users to create programs using a drag-and-drop interface with blocks that represent different programming concepts.

## Features

- Visual programming interface using Blockly
- Custom blocks for specific functionalities
- Save and load programs using local storage
- Run JavaScript code generated from blocks

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Drag and drop blocks from the toolbox to create your program.
3. Click "Run Code" to execute your program.
4. Use "Save Program" and "Load Program" to store and retrieve your work.

## Customization

You can add more custom blocks by defining them in the JavaScript section of `index.html`. Follow the pattern of the `custom_alert` block as an example.
